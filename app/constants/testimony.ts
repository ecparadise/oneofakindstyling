      "I love working with Abbey! She has the best eye for fashion. I booked a closet consult to prepare for an upcoming trip and she was so helpful. She encouraged me to finally get rid of old clothes and gave me inspiration for how to style pieces and craft a capsule wardrobe! Thanks to her I had so many cute outfits while I was traveling!",

      "Abbey is great!  I needed an outfit for an evening event and she helped me put together a silk tuxedo with shoes, purse and jewelry. The next time I saw Abbey she guided me on selecting a great sneaker for “everyday.” She’s a great resource and I will use her again. (Plus she’s fun to work with!)",

      "Abbey has such a talent for identifying pieces that I would never normally pick out for myself that looked AMAZING on! Especially being pregnant, I was feeling discouraged about trying on clothes. However, after consulting with Abbey, she has given me hope to find new pieces that make me feel confident, comfortable, and beautiful leaving the house! I can not recommend her services enough.",

      "I’ve known Abbey for years, so I already trusted her taste—but she still went above and beyond. She helped me pull together the finishing touches for my daughter’s rehearsal dinner outfit, and her eye for detail made all the difference. Her kindness, honesty, and natural sense of style are exactly why I value her opinion. I couldn’t recommend her more",
