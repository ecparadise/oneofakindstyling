      "I love working with Abbey! She has the best eye for fashion. I booked a closet consult to prepare for an upcoming trip and she was so helpful. She encouraged me to finally get rid of old clothes and gave me inspiration for how to style pieces and craft a capsule wardrobe! Thanks to her I had so many cute outfits while I was traveling!",

      "Abbey is great!  I needed an outfit for an evening event and she helped me put together a silk tuxedo with shoes, purse and jewelry. The next time I saw Abbey she guided me on selecting a great sneaker for “everyday.” She’s a great resource and I will use her again. (Plus she’s fun to work with!)",
